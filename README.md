<a href="https://bitchyshitshow.com/">Bitchy Shit Show</a> is an anti-oppression podcast. We approach all social justice topics from an anti-capitalist, anarchist, feminist, queer and pro-liberation perspective. We talk about things with a raw, philosophical viewpoint - always challenging ourselves and our listeners to think in a different way and grow from that experience.<br>
